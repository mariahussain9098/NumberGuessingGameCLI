# NumberGuessingGameCLI

This project is a simple command-line number guessing game built using TypeScript, Inquirer, and Chalk. Test your luck and see if you can guess the correct number!

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can guess a number between 1 and 10, with only three attempts to get it right.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Immediate feedback is provided after each guess, indicating whether the guess was correct or not.
- **Colorful Output:** Utilizing Chalk, the CLI displays colorful and stylized text to enhance the user experience.
- **Random Number Generation:** The system generates a random number each time the game is played, ensuring variability and unpredictability.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input their guess through the command line.
2. **Random Number Generation:**
   - The system generates a random number between 1 and 10.
3. **Win or Lose:**
   - If the user's guess matches the generated number, they win! Otherwise, they have three attempts to get it right.
4. **Feedback:**
   - After each guess, the user receives feedback indicating whether their guess was correct or if they have any attempts remaining.
